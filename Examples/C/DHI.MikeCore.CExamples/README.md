# MIKE Core C/C++ Examples
Examples of reading and writing dfs files in C/C++.

This project is set up as a C++ Unit Test project, 
using the `CppUnitTestFramework` from Visual Studio. 
To run it in Visual Studio, select:

* Build the solution. Build in debug mode to enable stepping around in the code.
* "Test" -> "Test Settings" -> "Default Processor Architecture" -> "X64"
* "Test" -> "Windows" -> "Test Explorer"
* In the "Test Explorer", select one or more tests to run, or click "Run All"

## Making it into an executable
If there are problems making the unit tests run, then there is also a `main` 
method in `DHI.MikeCore.CExamples.cpp`. Retarget the project to make an executable
and to start with that method, and then it is posssible to run and debug the executable instead.
