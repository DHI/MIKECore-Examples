# Download and install IronPython:
#   http://ironpython.net/download/
#
# Run like (for the 2.7 version): 
#   "c:\Program Files (x86)\IronPython 2.7\ipy.exe" create_dfs1.py
# or by simply double-clicking on the .py file
#
# If double-clicking does not work, then you have probably more than
# one python intepreter installed, and the "wrong" one is invoked
#
